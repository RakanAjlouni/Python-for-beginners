#Define variables for city, country, and continent
city = "Amman" #Here, we create a variable named city and assign it the name of the city where you live.

country= "Jordan" #Similarly, we create a variable named country and assign it the name of the country where you live.

continent = "Asia" #Finally, we create a variable named continent and assign it the name of the continent where you live.

#Display the information
print("City:", city) #This line prints out the text "City:" followed by the value stored in the variable 'city'.
#The 'Print' function is used to display information to the user.
#In this case, it prints the name of the city where you live.

print("Country:", country) #This line prints out the text "Country:" followed by the value stored in the variable 'country'.
#Similar to the previous line, it prints the name of the country where you live.
